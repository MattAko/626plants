## Description
A fullstack e-commerce platform created for my mother to grow her home flower business!

Created to have a simple and fast checkout experience for users/customers. In addition, having an admin portal that allows my mother to manage the items in the shop, manage pickup and online orders, and get in contact with customers.

## Notes/Future Changes
- Planning to restructure both frontend and backend file structures to allow for easier readability.
- Design changes to the shop.

## Things I learned
- File structure is extremely important in organizing code
- The more general purpose functions are, the better
- I should learn server-side rendering...
- Firebase Realtime Database is great for these smaller projects as it is quick and easy to implement. But I find the JSON tree structure annoying at points.
- Route names should be general, don't include the http request type in the name!
- VSCode >>>>

## Why did you make this?

I thought creating a personal e-commerce platform would be a good way to learn more about web development. I also saw benefits to designing the website myself rather than using premade templates offered by websites such as Shopify.


## Why Angular?!???!

Because Angular is cool?
